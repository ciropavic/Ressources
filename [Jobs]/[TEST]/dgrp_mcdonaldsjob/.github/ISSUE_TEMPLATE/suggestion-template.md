**Please do NOT remove any text from the template.**
Please add your title and add your answers below, if you have more information by all means add it, but do not remove any details already existing below, this will void your request and we will not respond if it is not filled out correctly.

**Disclaimer**
Due to the fact that many people are providing such little information and expecting us to be able to fix their problem, we are now enforcing these issue templates through github, if you fill these forms out incorrectly or provide little information, then expect little help in return, we, as addon creators spend days or weeks and even months or years doing this for FREE, both creating addons and giving support, so please show some courtesy and atleast have a fair go at diagnosing and fixing your problem before creating a post and possibly wasting not only your own time, but the people that are trying to create resources for server owners like you.
I have event spent a few hours alone creating these templates to avoid the generic, frutsrating server newbies that avoid doing the most basic diagnostics it's laughable.
So long story short, if you actually take the time to read this template it may even solve your issue before you need to create one.
Let's start with the Frequently Asked Questions.

**FAQ - (Frequently Asked Questions)**
Q: Why is nothing showing up but I have the McDonalds Job?
A: This is likely due to the fact that you have spelt the resource incorrectly in your server.cfg meaning the resource has failed to start check for any errors in your server.

Q: Why does rain come inside the building?
A: This happens with all YMAP Map Mods, please create your own building if this is a problem
